			<p>The SimpleFi Program offers organizations a differentiated employee/member benefit and a tool to help strengthen a culture of saving. The program provides members with financial education, starting from basic financial product understanding, the time value of money, on to more tax efficient saving programs available, and beyond.</p>
			<p>We also provide incentives to start saving and subsidized funding to help get out of expensive debt.</p>

			<p>For employers, we work with the HR team and payroll providers to reduce transaction costs and enhance the credit profile of the employee.</p>
			<p>The lower cost of processing and lower cost of borrowing is passed on to member savers and borrowers as a benefit. We report to credit bureaus so that members participating in the program also can start improving their credit scores with the aim to permanently get off expensive debt.</p>

			<p>SimpleFi administers and funds the program, also providing a platform for members to help one another.</p> 
      <p>We also place minimal burden on host organizations as we process the saving / loan requests and automate deductions and disbursements via payroll systems. We aim to help members better understand the financial services they use, get off expensive debt, and start saving more sooner.</p>
      <p>We hope that participating employers will enjoy better productivity and retention with a financially healthier workforce and that community organizations build closer knit members as they support each other.</p>
