			<p>The SimpleFi team believe that there is an urgent need for basic finance education for many people currently over paying for debt. We also understand financial assistance is sometimes needed to help those stuck in debt traps, get a fresh start and learn techniques to start getting their finances under control.</p>
			<p>We are grateful to our investors who have provided patient capital to help prove our sustainable social business model and hope you share our vision and can help in turning around the notion that finance is hard.  <b>Let's make finance simple.</b></p>
